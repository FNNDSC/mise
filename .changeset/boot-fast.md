Faster daemon entry. A restored `/proc` roster now goes into service on a delta (feeds newer than the highest restored id) instead of a full feed-index walk; the full walk runs behind the listening daemon and reports how many feeds moved while it was away, each refreshing on its next visit (`procRoster_bootSync`; `procRoster_sync` now returns the feeds it brought in or found changed). The rendered `/etc/group` projection lives in the listing cache, so it survives a restart with the listings: past its freshness window it serves at once and re-renders behind itself, and a local membership change still forces a synchronous re-render. The listing checkpoint accepts any JSON payload, not only listings.
