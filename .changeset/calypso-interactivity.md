Interactivity over the wire: a builtin that prompts during a remote command now reaches the surface running it. The contract gains a `prompt` request (daemon→surface, with hidden-input support) and a `promptAnswer` reply (surface→daemon). The daemon serializes execution across the whole session so a mid-command prompt has one unambiguous target, and exposes an input broker (`prompt_current`) the host wires into its `Surface`; the `chell --daemon` launcher installs a surface whose `prompt` delegates to it, so `repl_question` (passwords, confirmations, the plugin admin flow, the prompt configurator) works over the wire unchanged. The `chell --remote` client answers incoming prompt requests from its own terminal (hidden when asked) and replies. Completion already round-trips from the earlier daemon work; the themed pushed prompt string and client-side pipe-segment execution remain follow-ups.
