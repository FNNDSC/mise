Run pipeline segments on the surface, never on the daemon host. Segment execution becomes a surface capability: the `Surface` gains `pipeSegments` (a capability flag) and a `pipeSegment(command, input)` method. The local CLI runs segments in-process exactly as before (byte-identical); the daemon's surface routes them over the wire (new `pipe`/`pipeResult` messages, base64 for the bytes) to the surface running the command, which runs them on its own machine — so a pipeline like `ls | grep foo` never spawns anything on the daemon host, closing that attack surface. A surface without the capability (a browser) fails such pipelines with a clear message. Completes the interactivity work: prompts, completion, the pushed prompt string, and pipe segments all now work over the wire.
