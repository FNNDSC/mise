The surface owns the local editor, so `edit` works over the wire. The `Surface` gains a `localEdit(content, extension)` method (resolving the flag-only deferral from the prompt-capability work): the CLI surface backs it with the temp-file-and-`$EDITOR` mechanics that used to live in the `edit` builtin, and the daemon backs it by routing to the surface running the command (new `edit`/`editResult` messages + an `edit_current` broker) so the operator's own editor opens, never one on the daemon host. The `edit` builtin no longer touches processes or temp files for editing — it fetches the file, hands the content to `surface.localEdit`, and uploads the result; `chell --remote` opens the client's editor. A surface without the `localEdit` capability (a browser) fails `edit` with a clear message.
