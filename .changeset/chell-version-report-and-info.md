`chell --version` reported brasa's version in place of chell's: the version module moved into brasa during the engine split but still read its own `package.json` as "chell", so it printed brasa's number. It now resolves every package by name (reading brasa's own directly) and reports the full stack — chell, brasa, chili, salsa, cumin, calypso — with versions aligned in a column. A new `chell --info` flag prints a role-grouped table (surfaces / engine / layers) of each package, its full name, and version. The version report, the `--info` table, and the boot panel all draw from a single source of truth in brasa (`stackInfo_get`), and the standalone binary inlines every stack version at build time.
