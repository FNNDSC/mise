Making folders with parents never puts one over a file or beneath one, and missing parents no longer fail the command. `mkdir -p a/b/c` had made the folders and still exited 1, because looking up a parent that was not there left its complaint on the error stack. `mkdir` now goes through the backend's filesystem. fond's mounts gain `mkdirTree` (a folder and its parents in one step, as CUBE makes them), and the contract holds it: EEXIST for anything already there, ENOTDIR beneath a file. A mount without `mkdirTree` is walked one parent at a time. Under `-p`, something already there counts as done only when it is a folder; a file is `File exists`. salsa's `folderPath_holder` names the nearest thing holding a path or a parent of it. The fs views (`mkdir_render` and its kin) live in fond.
