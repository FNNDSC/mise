Preserve failure causes and tighten cache contracts. Errors that were replaced by generic messages now carry their real cause: controller and handler creation failures name the underlying error instead of "no ChRIS context", `cat` shows the actual fetch failure, docker command failures surface stderr detail, context-set errors actually print, settings load/save failures are announced instead of silently using defaults or losing changes, unreadable berth and discovery files are named instead of reading as "no daemon", token-file read errors are distinguished from the logged-out state, and resource deletes report why they failed. Every remaining deliberate error absorption now carries a dated adjudication comment. Cache contracts: the PACS provider's decoded-query cache caches settled results only and is size-bounded; the object-context factory gains an eviction hook (`objContext_evict`) for deleted plugin or feed ids; `mv` and `cp` invalidate the whole affected listing subtree; and a new PACS query invalidates the cached `/net/pacs/queries` listing so it appears in the next `ls` immediately.
