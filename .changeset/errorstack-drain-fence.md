Make the error stack async-context aware and drain it per command. cumin's `errorStack` gains `scope_run` (run work against an isolated stack), `checkpoint_mark`, and `checkpoint_drain`: fire-and-forget background work (topology warm-up, background cache refresh) now runs inside its own scope so its error traffic cannot land in a concurrent foreground command's drain window. chell's dispatch checkpoints the stack before each command and drains anything pushed above the checkpoint into the envelope's `errors` field, escalating status to `error` when a genuine error was left on the stack — a reliable per-command failure signal that also retires the exit-code-delta status heuristic's blind spot (a later failing batch segment no longer reads `ok`). CLI behavior is byte-identical.
