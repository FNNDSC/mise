`image <path>`'s text reflection now carries a thumbnail of the middle slice, so a TTY sharing the session shows the picture, not only the facts. The kernel reads the slice's pixels (`dicomSlice_gray` in salsa, uncompressed transfer syntaxes via dcmjs), window/levels to 8-bit with MONOCHROME1 inverted, and box-downsamples to a cell grid; brasa renders it as an ASCII ramp on any pipe or ANSI truecolour half-blocks (`▀`) on a colour terminal. Colour is a new declared surface capability: ARGUS declares it (its DOM console renders ANSI), chell reads its own terminal through chalk, a bare pipe gets the ramp. Compressed pixels say so in one line rather than pulling a codec into the kernel; an unreadable slice leaves the facts and no picture. The ASCII ramp is always the floor.
