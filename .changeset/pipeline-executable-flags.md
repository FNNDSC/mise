Route a pipeline executable's bare `--signalflow` flag to SignalFlow diagram output and provide contextual help for dynamic pipeline commands. Keep final-segment redirection on the originating surface, propagate remote pipe-segment failures back to the engine, and prevent remote command errors from terminating the interactive ChELL client. Daemon mode now reports shared startup cache warming and publishes its listening berth only after engine readiness. Consistently document `signalflow -` for stdin rendering.
