A failed copy says why without the stack's internal markers (no more `cp: [StaticVfsProvider.cp …] | cp: …`). Underneath, every filesystem operation answers with a reason (#1001). fond adds the filesystem contract: `VfsErrno`, `VfsOutcome` and `vfsRefusal_text`, which keeps the shell's existing wording for each refusal. Mount operations (read, readBinary, write, mkdir, rmdir, rename, cp, and the new rm and rmTree) return an outcome instead of a boolean or `Result`. The dispatcher asks the fallback too, through its path resolver. fond also adds `MemoryVfsProvider`, a complete in-memory mount, and `VFS_CONTRACT`, the cases any mount must pass. salsa's mounts and dispatcher return outcomes, so its callers change (a major bump). A mount's own message travels as the reason, so every refusal reads as before. proc's unreachable `rm` becomes `feedJobs_cancel`.
