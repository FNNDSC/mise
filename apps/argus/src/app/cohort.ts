/**
 * @file The session's cohort: ONE per session, the session's rather than
 * any pane's — it spans PACS series and will span directories, so it cannot
 * live in whichever pane started it. The header band shows it; a GATHER
 * pane on the main panel can show the same one at the same time. The band
 * and the pane are two reflections of one set, and their handlers are one
 * set of handlers, parameterised by where the work lands and where a
 * question stands.
 *
 * The cohort itself is the kernel's. A press here sends the `gather` verb
 * the operator could have typed, and the verb's answer — the whole cohort,
 * as `gather.cohort` — is what the views redraw from; so is the answer to a
 * line typed at any chell on the session. Nothing here writes the cohort.
 *
 * A module of the host: the host hands in its open verbs, its asks and its
 * stage as hooks; the module keeps the reflection and the band's panel.
