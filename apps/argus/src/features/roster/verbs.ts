/**
 * @file The verb roster: which controls a row offers, and when.
 *
 * Every listing that gives its rows verbs declares them here, once, and the
 * panes read this rather than each carrying its own list. Two things follow
 * from that. A pane cannot quietly stop offering a verb, because the verb
 * is not the pane's to forget. And a verb cannot quietly arrive, because
 * adding one means editing this file, where what it displaces is visible.
 *
 * This is not a test fixture. The panes build their action tracks from
 * these rules, so what the roster says and what an operator is offered are
 * the same statement; the test then asks a real listing what it renders and
 * holds it to the roster, exhaustively, in order.
 *
 * The rule owns the label and the condition. It never owns the doing: what
 * a verb runs needs the pane's own hands (a terminal, a session, a
 * retrieve), so a pane supplies `run` by the verb's name.
 *
 * Written after a verb went missing. GATHER, the control a whole workflow
 * starts with, stopped being offered on every series already in CUBE and
 * every test stayed green, because no test had ever asked a listing what it
 * offers.
