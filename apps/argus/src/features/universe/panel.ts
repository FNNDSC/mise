/**
 * @file The UNIVERSE pane: the space of everything run here.
 *
 * Every feed the index holds, drawn as its own small molecule — a sphere
 * per plugin group, sized by jobs and hued by status — and pulled toward
 * the feeds that share its pipeline shape, so the field reads as what this
 * lab runs, how much of each, and where the red is. Its own pane kind
 * (docs/aegis.adoc: a session's universe is its own pane), so RUNS-02
 * stays a feed viewer and this keeps its camera and its memory.
 *
 * It breathes. While the index warms, each landing the prompt reports adds
 * or reshapes a molecule. Once the index is whole it keeps moving with the
 * lab: a feed arriving through the roster delta drifts in, a status change
 * recolours, a feed gone from the roster leaves. And it remembers: where
 * the molecules settled is kept per identity, so a reopened pane finds them
 * where they were.
