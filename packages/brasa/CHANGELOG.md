# @fnndsc/brasa

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d69b086: Every printing builtin now returns a `CommandEnvelope` instead of writing to the console. `files`/`links`/`dirs`, `feed`, `plugin`, and `parametersofplugin` were the last holdouts; with them converted, the per-invocation console monkeypatch (`printingHandler_wrap`, which hijacked `console.log`/`console.error`/`process.stdout.write` to capture a builtin's output) is deleted, along with the `LiveEnvelopeOutputSink` marker that only served it.

  Behavioural notes: unknown subcommands of these resource commands now return a clear error envelope instead of spawning a chili subprocess, and `search` is handled natively via `list --search`. The unknown-_command_ fallback still delegates to chili, now over the same print-direct path as the other unconverted handlers.
