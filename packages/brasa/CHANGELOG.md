### Minor Changes

- 0adb4f2: The daemon terminal gets a resting state: the console face.

  The boot-phase brain animation repainted by cursor arithmetic against a
  scrolling buffer — counting rows printed beneath it and jumping up — so a
  retry warning landing mid-frame interleaved with the art, and the pulse had
  to kill itself the moment output scrolled the logo away: the brain went
  silent exactly when the daemon came alive.

  Boot is unchanged and text-first: the brain prints, pulses while
  credentials are checked, and every address and token scrolls into ordinary
  scrollback. What is new is what happens when boot completes on a TTY: the
  daemon switches to the alternate screen buffer — the same screen vim and
  htop own — where the brain pulses forever at fixed coordinates over an
  identity panel (identity, wire, ARGUS URL, token, berth, attach line,
  uptime, attached surfaces, index counts), with the last few log lines caged
  in a dim strip beneath. The pulse is honest: idle is a slow shimmer, an
  executing command quickens it, a surface attaching flares it.

  Esc or `q` drops to the normal buffer, restored byte-perfect with the boot
  log intact and the lines captured while the face was up flushed beneath it;
  any key returns. Ctrl-C stops the daemon from either mode. Off a TTY
  (systemd, nohup) nothing changes: sequential logging, as before.

  The brain art and its frame renderer moved from chell to brasa
  (`logo_frameRender`, `logo_linesRender`, and the new `logoRows_count` /
  `logoColumns_count`), so any surface can draw it; chell keeps only its
  boot-terminal animation host. `daemon_launch` now returns the launched
  daemon's addresses and handle, which both launch paths (`chell --daemon`
  and the standalone `calypso` binary) feed to the face.

- 31c2a50: `pipeline diagram` and `feed diagram` now carry their graphs as typed
  envelope models: `pipeline.diagram` (the authored topology) and `feed.dag`
  (the live instance graph with statuses and each node's `/proc` data
  address). The rendered trees are unchanged; a graphical surface reads the
  model where a terminal reads the text — one command, two projections.
- 9ed68cd: `download` no longer writes to the daemon host's disk. File delivery is now a
  surface capability, like prompting, piping and editing already were.

  The builtin resolved its destination with `path.resolve()` inside the engine,
  so the bytes landed on whatever machine hosted the engine. For a local shell
  that is right — the engine is in-process and the operator's disk is the
  engine's disk. Under a daemon it put files on a machine nobody attending the
  session was sitting at, and from a browser the question "download to where?"
  had no answer at all.

  `Surface` gains `fileDeliver`, and `SurfaceCapabilities` gains `fileDelivery`
  alongside `engineFilesystem` — which says whether a path the engine resolves is
  a path this surface's operator can open. Only an in-process local shell claims
  it. When it is false, `download` hands the file to the surface, which puts it
  somewhere its operator can actually reach: the client's disk for
  `chell --remote`, the download manager for `argus`.

  Only the request crosses the wire. Each surface fetches the bytes itself
  through the daemon's existing token-gated `/vfs` route, so a DICOM series is
  not base64'd across a channel meant for session state — the intent travels
  through the vocabulary and the bytes travel through the byte route.

  The local path is unchanged: a local `chell` still uses the existing transfer
  machinery, with its globs, directory walks and progress reporting.

  A directory has no bytes to hand over, and what to do about that depends on
  what the surface has — a third capability, `localFilesystem`, declared in the
  attach handshake and answered by the surface rather than by the daemon. A shell
  owns a filesystem wherever it runs, so `chell --remote` receives the tree file
  by file and gets the folder it asked for. A browser owns no directory and can
  take files only one at a time, so several hundred DICOM instances would be
  several hundred saves; for that surface alone a directory is archived into a
  single CUBE file first, through
  the registered `zip v20240311` pipeline — `pl-dircopy` into a zip plugin, the
  same mechanism the ChRIS web UI has used for years, but living in `brasa` where
  every surface reaches one implementation instead of each client re-deriving the
  sequence. `CHRIS_ARCHIVE_PIPELINE` names a different pipeline where a
  deployment registered one. When it is absent, the failure says which pipeline
  is missing and that it can be registered from the store.

  The archive run announces itself rather than creating a feed silently, because
  it is a workaround for CUBE having no directory-archive route: issue #233.

  `upload` has the mirror problem — it reads from the engine host's disk — and is
  not addressed here, because the browser direction needs a file picker. See
  issue #232.

- e58bf58: The wire contract moves out of `calypso` into a package of its own,
  `@fnndsc/menu`.

  A surface author should depend on the contract, not on the daemon that happens
  to serve it. Until now the contract was a subpath of `@fnndsc/calypso`, so a
  third-party surface took a dependency on the session host to learn the shape of
  a result. `menu` imports nothing from the stack and sits below `cumin`, so both
  the engine that produces envelopes and the browser that renders them can load
  it.

  Two vocabularies the contract narrows to moved with it, because they were
  declared above the thing that describes them: the structured-progress values
  (previously `@fnndsc/brasa/progress`) and the prompt-facing process-index state
  (previously `@fnndsc/cumin/proc-prompt`). Both are re-exported from their old
  homes, so existing importers are unaffected; `@fnndsc/cumin/proc-prompt` as a
  subpath is gone, and its types are available from `@fnndsc/cumin` directly.

  `CommandEnvelope` is now inferred from the schema that validates it. The engine
  and the wire previously carried separate declarations of the same shape, tied
  together by a compile-time assertion that one stayed assignable to the other; a
  single inferred type makes that drift impossible rather than detected.
  `@fnndsc/cumin` re-exports the name, so nothing that imports it changes.

  `@fnndsc/calypso/protocol` no longer exists as a subpath. Import
  `@fnndsc/menu`. The names remain re-exported from `@fnndsc/calypso` itself for
  now, since most of the stack has always reached them there.

  This is the scaffold for envelope Phase-2 — a typed result model for every
  command — recorded in `docs/menu.adoc`. `menu` itself is unpublished until that
  work lands, so thirty payload shapes can settle without forcing a release each
  time.

- e062dbf: Two more commands speak in models: `proc feeds` (now listing the whole
  cache-resident roster when unqueried) carries a `feed.list` model, and
  `pacs query` carries a `pacs.query` model — studies and series with their
  instance UIDs and pullable VFS paths. Terminal renderings are unchanged.
- 28b9a9f: Regard: the session learns what the operator is indicating.

  The wire contract gains one message, `regard`, travelling both directions
  under one shape: a surface reports the addressable thing the operator most
  recently indicated (a file clicked in a browser, a DAG node selected), and
  the daemon retains it as session truth — last write wins — mirrors it into
  the engine, and rebroadcasts it to every attached surface. A late attacher
  receives the retained value with its ack, so spawn-then-see workflows start
  seeing immediately.

  The value is an address in the namespace plus the model kind it was
  indicated through, never view-space coordinates: what has no address is view
  state and stays surface-side. The brasa session retains the value behind
  `regard_get`/`regard_set`, so engine-side consumers can answer "what is the
  operator regarding" without any surface geometry crossing the seam. Design
  record: apps/argus/docs/aegis.adoc.

- 8842ab4: Indeterminate progress now crosses the daemon wire as typed facts rather than
  terminal escapes.

  The spinner used to write `\r\x1b[K<frame>` and cursor hide/show to the status
  channel twelve times a second, so every attached surface received terminal
  choreography whether or not it was a terminal — a web surface had to emulate a
  character grid to recover the meaning, and got it subtly wrong. It now announces
  `operation: 'task'`, `kind: 'inspection'`, `phase: 'working'` with a label, and
  closes with `phase: 'complete'`. Each surface draws waiting in its own idiom.

  Only state changes cross the wire: frames and elapsed counters are the
  renderer's, so a spin of any length costs two events instead of dozens per
  second. `chell` gained the elapsed counter its spinner used to bake into the
  label, and `argus` gained a full progress renderer — indeterminate work spins,
  counted work fills a bar — which also surfaces the download progress it had
  been silently discarding.

  The `operation` and `phase` enums gained `task` and `working`. Every enum on
  the progress message now degrades on an unknown value instead of failing the
  parse and dropping the message whole: `operation` to `task`, `phase` to
  `working`, `status` to `unknown`, `kind` and `unit` to absent. That makes good
  the contract's promise that change within a major is additive — for future
  additions, since the fallback lives in the build doing the reading.

  The spinner keeps its call signature, so its callers are unchanged. Its
  `showTiming` and `clearLine` arguments are now ignored: both are rendering
  decisions. It also no longer inspects `process.stdout.isTTY` before announcing,
  which had suppressed progress inside the daemon, where the engine's own stdout
  is never a terminal but the attached surface may well be able to draw.

### Patch Changes

- 1d600ac: An archive that cannot run no longer leaves a feed behind, and says the right
  reason for not running.

  Live testing found both. `download <dir>` from a browser reported that the
  `zip v20240311` pipeline was not registered, directly below a line explaining
  that one of its nodes was not registered on the target compute environment. The
  pipeline was present; the advice to fetch it from the store was wrong. Every
  `pipeline_run` failure had been collapsed into the one message.

  `pipeline_readiness` in salsa answers whether a pipeline exists and could be
  prepared, distinguishing _unregistered_ from _registered but unpreparable_ —
  different problems calling for different actions.

  Preparing a pipeline needs no previous instance, so readiness is now checked
  _before_ the feed is created. The failed run above had already created a feed
  that nothing then used, leaving litter in a feed list and a copy in the compute
  graph asserting an analysis that produced nothing.

  A run that fails after its feed exists now removes it, and names the feed when
  removal fails. A run that merely exceeds its time limit is left alone, since it
  may yet finish and deleting would remove the feed from under a running job.

- 1c195a7: Execution metrics ride the warmup for free: node differentiation lands.

  Every CUBE plugin-instance list row already carries `start_date`,
  `end_date`, and `size` — the same rows warmup and status refresh page
  through. They are now typed on the contract, captured into the proc cache
  (`ProcInstance.startedAt/finishedAt/outputBytes`, merged defined-only so a
  refresh never erases what warmup saw), persisted by the checkpoint, and
  projected by `feed diagram` onto each node's `metrics` (wall-clock
  `computeSeconds`, `dataBytes`). Zero new CUBE calls at any point.

  The molecule rendering scales by them (a SCALE pill flips between wall
  time and output bytes, re-projecting the remembered model locally), and
  timestamp-true pulse replay becomes possible.

- 87f7c59: The `pacs.query` model now says what CUBE already holds: each series carries
  a `pulled` flag and file count (one bounded sweep of single-attempt lookups),
  and studies carry their own VFS path so a surface can pull a whole study.
- 3125517: A dropped retrieve watch is no longer reported as a failed pull.

  Pulling a 22-series study reported `0/22 series complete` with every series
  marked `ERROR` — and the CUBE path report printed immediately below it listed
  four of those same series with real paths and file counts. The retrieves were
  fine; the watch had died.

  One websocket failure marked every in-flight series `error`, because
  `RetrieveStatus` had no value meaning _the client stopped watching and does not
  know the outcome_. The code knew the difference — a comment in `pull` says a
  watch failure "is usually cosmetic, the PACS keeps pushing and CUBE keeps
  registering after detach" — but nothing downstream acted on it.

  A lost watch now marks its series `unconfirmed`. The confirmation loop, which
  already asks CUBE about series whose confirmation went missing, now asks about
  these too: a series CUBE reports as stored is `pulled`, with its file count and
  path, whatever the watch managed to see.

  What remains unconfirmed is reported as unknown rather than lost — `? … [WATCH
ENDED — may still be arriving]` — and does not fail the command, because
  nothing in the client knows that it failed. A series that was never fired is
  still a real failure and still fails the command.

- b39b584: A dropped retrieve watch reconnects instead of giving up.

  The LONK socket is only how a client watches a retrieve; the retrieve itself
  runs on the server and is unaffected by the socket dying. Losing the view was
  nonetheless the end of the watch — which is why a 22-series study failed where
  a 2-series one did not: a longer retrieve gives the socket more chances to
  drop.

  A dropped socket is now reopened, up to three times, and re-subscribed to the
  series still in flight. Nothing is re-fired: those retrieves were never lost.
  The reconnection is announced, because a silent one during a long pull is
  indistinguishable from a stall.

  Only when reconnection is exhausted does the watch stop, and it still records
  the remaining series as `unconfirmed` rather than failed.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ad04f2: The engine can now hand raw file bytes to a hosting daemon: brasa's `BrasaEngine` gains an optional `file_read(filePath)` that resolves a ChRIS VFS path to a `Buffer` through chili's binary cat. Calypso's daemon exposes it as a token-gated `/vfs?path=&token=` HTTP route with extension-derived content types, letting a web surface render images and other binary content that a text transcript cannot carry.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- b0b478b: PACS payload and path-grammar consolidation. Cumin gains `dicomPayload`, the one home for DICOM query-payload interpretation (tag unwrapping including the DICOM-JSON `{Value: [...]}` form, study and series array location, UID lookups), replacing four diverged private copies. Salsa's `pacsHelpers` becomes the single authority for the PACS folder grammar, adding `folderUID_get`, `queryLabel_extractFromFolder`, and `queryFolderName_build`; the query path a surface builds now always matches the name the listing shows, including the title fallback the old builder lacked. Brasa's `pacsUtils` and `query` builtins consume the shared helpers; `pacs_tagValueExtract` remains as a compatibility alias.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 69b0617: Typed chell API, third tranche: `cp` and `mv` join the facade with their
  existing `fs.cp`/`fs.mv` models. Fixing what their first typed run
  surfaced: file rename was silently broken against current CUBEs (the PUT
  field drifted from `path` to `upload_path`); cumin now sends the current
  field and falls back for older servers.
- 7ed8e1c: Typed chell API, second tranche: `ls` and `cat`. `ls` gains the
  `fs.listing` model (entries per target as data), `cat` joins with its
  existing `fs.cat` outcomes and content in the rendered channel, and both
  enter the same cores the parsed builtins enter. Programmatic `cat` never
  injects syntax highlighting.
- 7dc3bca: The typed chell API, first tranche. `chellApi_create()` returns the shell's
  vocabulary as function calls: `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch` and `rm` take
  typed options, enter the same per-command cores the parsed builtins enter,
  and return envelopes whose model slot is typed per command
  (`TypedEnvelope<K>` over the new `FsModelMap`). No command line is
  assembled or parsed anywhere on the path.

### Patch Changes

- 5285bd5: Cast burndown to the adapter floor. The wire contract gains the pipelines
  surface (`pipeline_get` with piping items and plugin metadata handles,
  `pipelineSourceFilesPage_get`); salsa's pipeline modules, feed joins, and
  brasa/chili call sites migrate onto typed accessors and honest converters.
  The repository's `as unknown as` count is now 2, both inside the licensed
  adapter seam, and the CI ratchet holds it there. chell progress bars also
  draw on the renderer's configured stream instead of assuming stdout.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 22db63f: Make PACS pulls observable and recoverable. A new `pacs status <expression | path | queryId>` reports one line per series: a fill bar of files registered in CUBE against the PACS-reported instance count, the derived state, and the in-CUBE `/SERVICES` folder for every landed series; an expression reuses the caller's most recent matching query instead of minting a new record per check. `pull` is now idempotent: series already fully registered in CUBE are skipped before firing, so re-running the same pull fetches exactly the missing series. Retrieve firing gets three attempts with backoff and is bounded to four concurrent creations, replacing the all-at-once stampede that overloaded CUBE and silently lost retrieves. A series whose firing still fails is reported as `FAILED TO FIRE, will not arrive; re-run pull`, distinct from watch-side failures, which now point at `pacs status` since their transfers usually complete server-side anyway. Cumin's status report gains the per-series storage folder (`seriesStorage_resolve`). The failure modes and operator playbook are documented in docs/pacs-pull-recovery.adoc.
- 590a943: Converge the two PACS retrieve watchers onto one engine. pull's battle-tested LONK machinery (bounded, retried firing; stall/timeout/no-activity detection; storage confirmation; refire loop) moves into salsa as the presentation-free `retrieve/watch` module; the `pull` builtin becomes a thin consumer rendering engine events onto its sink, and the PACS VFS provider's `cp` drops its 5-second polling watcher for the same engine, gaining firing retry, LONK push, and the idempotency skip. The convergence surfaced and fixed two latent defects that had made PACS `cp` unusable on real paths: the source parser assumed paths without the `/queries/` segment and rejected every real listing path, and the file downloader only consulted the userfiles collection, so PACS files under `/SERVICES` read as "not found"; it now falls back to the PACS files collection. Supporting dedup: cumin gains `retry_untilValue` (the one bounded-backoff loop) and `seriesStorage_resolve` gains bounded re-probing, replacing the per-package storage-resolver copies; the `_qid:` parser is now shared from salsa.
- b2f5ad3: Greet every surface with the stack's identity. Builds now record the short git hash they were produced from (`dist/buildinfo.json`, written by the new `scripts/buildinfo.mjs` build step), and brasa exposes it through `buildHash_get` alongside `welcomeLine_build`/`welcomeLine_compose`, which render a banner of the form `ChELL Executes Layered Logic, v 5.3.0 (886f09). Welcome.` An interactive chell session prints the banner and a short fortune at boot, the calypso daemon announces its banner plus an aligned version line for every stack layer (chell, brasa, chili, salsa, cumin, calypso) when it starts listening, and the attach handshake gains an optional `stack` field carrying all six versions and the build hash, so a remote surface banners the daemon's full reported stack rather than its local install's. `fortune_random` is exported for reuse, with an optional line-count bound so banners favour short cookies.

### Patch Changes

- 2e60785: Cache the `/etc/group` projection per CUBE connection for five minutes,
  invalidate it after ChELL membership changes, and show semantic inspection
  progress while an uncached projection is resolving.
- 66bc932: Add ChELL group membership commands and include current CUBE usernames in the
  live `/etc/group` projection.
- 8ec8a4b: Add explicit, command-scoped CUBE elevation with `sudo <command>`. The active surface collects an administrator identity and hidden password; a temporary CUBE client runs only the nested command, then the normal session is restored. Group membership and plugin registration now suggest a copyable `sudo` rerun after an authorization failure, and plugin registration no longer owns a separate interactive admin prompt.
- d0ac04f: Preserve failure causes and tighten cache contracts. Errors that were replaced by generic messages now carry their real cause: controller and handler creation failures name the underlying error instead of "no ChRIS context", `cat` shows the actual fetch failure, docker command failures surface stderr detail, context-set errors actually print, settings load/save failures are announced instead of silently using defaults or losing changes, unreadable berth and discovery files are named instead of reading as "no daemon", token-file read errors are distinguished from the logged-out state, and resource deletes report why they failed. Every remaining deliberate error absorption now carries a dated adjudication comment. Cache contracts: the PACS provider's decoded-query cache caches settled results only and is size-bounded; the object-context factory gains an eviction hook (`objContext_evict`) for deleted plugin or feed ids; `mv` and `cp` invalidate the whole affected listing subtree; and a new PACS query invalidates the cached `/net/pacs/queries` listing so it appears in the next `ls` immediately.
- 886f09c: Fix stale directory state in long-lived daemons. Folder object contexts are no longer cached in the cumin context factory: folder paths are not stable identities in CUBE (deleting and re-uploading a directory assigns a new folder id), so a group bound at first touch kept serving the dead folder for the life of the process, which in a calypso daemon meant a freshly uploaded directory listed as permanently empty and `ls -f` could not recover it. Plugin and feed contexts keep their stable-id cache. The listing cache gains `cache_invalidateTree`, and `rm` and directory uploads now invalidate the whole affected subtree, so a delete-and-re-upload cycle cannot serve still-fresh nested listings from the old tree. The salsa native provider also distinguishes a missing folder from an empty one: when every sub-listing comes back empty it probes the parent, and a nonexistent path reports "No such file or directory" instead of rendering as an empty directory.
- 50e9bb1: Make CUBE group membership commands name-first and batch-capable. `group members`, `group inspect`, `group adduser`, and `group removeuser` now accept an exact group name or a numeric ID; add and remove accept multiple usernames, report every result, and make already-satisfied membership changes successful no-ops.
- d0ac04f: BEHAVIOR CHANGE: failures no longer read as empty results. Commands that previously printed nothing and exited 0 when a fetch failed now report the error and exit non-zero, following the codebase's `Result<T>` pattern throughout. Affected surfaces: listing a PACS study or series that does not exist errors instead of showing an empty directory; `store list`/`store search` and `compute list` error when the store or CUBE is unreachable instead of showing no entries; plugin registration no longer defaults to the `host` compute resource when the compute fetch failed; `rm` on a feed fails when running jobs could not be cancelled instead of claiming success; a recursive scan that cannot list a subtree reports the exclusion instead of silently omitting it; batch job-status gaps and disconnected status fetches push visible warnings; the native VFS distinguishes "folder absent" from "could not verify" so probe failures no longer masquerade as missing directories; `cp` fails when path resolution fails rather than proceeding with a guessed path; join-edge resolution retries after a transient failure instead of permanently recording no joins; and the remote client reports invalid daemon messages instead of silently dropping them. Exit codes are now truthful end to end: `ls` reports an error status when any listing fails instead of aggregating failures into success, and `chell -c` derives its exit code from the command's envelopes, so a failed one-shot command exits non-zero even when the builtin did not set an exit code itself.
- ac69b3e: Run ChELL shell escapes on the originating surface, including remote clients,
  instead of exposing the CALYPSO daemon host process and filesystem.
- 0e92d4d: Persist and reconcile daemon `/proc` checkpoints, fix wildcard listing of
  virtual executables, keep remote admin prompts on their originating surface,
  add a Unix-style `id` builtin for the current CUBE UID/GID projection and group
  memberships, and make versioned-plugin help, parameters, and README output
  compose correctly through terminals, pipes, and redirects.
- fa81126: Retain failed `/proc` topology sweep state and add `proc retry` to continue at
  the failed page without repeating already successful pagination work.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 71a6cd4: Route a pipeline executable's bare `--signalflow` flag to SignalFlow diagram output and provide contextual help for dynamic pipeline commands. Keep final-segment redirection on the originating surface, propagate remote pipe-segment failures back to the engine, and prevent remote command errors from terminating the interactive ChELL client. Daemon mode now reports shared startup cache warming and publishes its listening berth only after engine readiness. Consistently document `signalflow -` for stdin rendering.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e630f79: Draw registered CUBE pipelines with `pipeline diagram <id|name>` or the `/bin` shorthand `<pipeline> --diagram`. Bare output uses the same shallow tree machinery as feed diagrams, `--withargs` appends stored non-null plugin defaults, and `--signalflow` emits the same SignalFlow YAML dialect as feeds. `feed diagram <specifier>` is now a shallow alias of `feed tree`; feed graph commands accept IDs, `feed_N`, exact or unambiguous title searches, and infer the feed from the current `feed_N` directory when omitted.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ac7ef9: Add `feed diagram --signalflow <feedId>` — emits a feed's DAG as a **SignalFlow YAML
  document to stdout**, composed with pipes rather than rendered in place:

  ```
  feed diagram --signalflow 1669 | signalflow -            # ASCII
  feed diagram --signalflow 1669 | signalflow - -o x.svg   # SVG
  feed diagram --signalflow 1669 > feed-1669.yaml          # keep it
  ```

  It builds the graph cache-first, collapses isomorphic siblings into named `×N` chips, and
  encodes topological-join edges via SignalFlow's node-reuse mechanism. mise emits the
  representation only — no renderer is invoked, discovered, or bundled — so there is nothing
  to install for the command itself; rendering is the user's own `signalflow`. `--signalflow`
  names the dialect, leaving room for further emitters (`--json`, `--dot`, …).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b8ae635: `feed tree` now collapses isomorphic sibling subtrees by default. Structurally-identical
  branches merge into one `×N` template node showing a proportional status bar, per-category
  counts (`97✓ 2⋯ 1✗`), and the ids of any non-done members (error first) so failures stay
  addressable. Collapsed groups use a double-line connector to signal multiplicity. Pass
  `--flat` to draw every node individually.
- ca63e8b: Add `feed tree <feedId>` — renders a feed's plugin-instance DAG as an annotated text
  tree. The anchor tree is drawn with box-drawing connectors; topological-join (`ts`) nodes
  are annotated inline with the extra sources they merge (`⋈ joins ...`). Supports
  `--focus <id>` to scope to a subtree and `--max-nodes <n>` to cap output (0 = all). The
  envelope carries a typed `feed.tree` FeedGraph model.

### Patch Changes

- 01ab743: `feed tree` now builds the DAG **cache-first** from the warm ProcCache instead of
  re-crawling the feed on every call. It reuses already-loaded topology, fetches feed
  metadata only when missing or a placeholder, refreshes volatile status cheaply (one
  feed-scoped list call, active nodes only) when reusing a warm cache, and resolves join
  edges lazily. New salsa exports: `feedGraphData_ensure`, `feedMeta_ensure`,
  `feedInstances_ensureLoaded`, `feedStatus_refresh`.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 0d358c5: /proc now caches settled job status. A finished plugin instance
  (`finishedSuccessfully`, `finishedWithError`, `cancelled`) never changes, so its
  status is kept permanently once observed. Consequences:

  - Listing a fully-finished feed under `/proc/jobs` is instant — no status calls.
  - Live status for active feeds is refreshed with a single feed-scoped list call
    (the list response already carries `status`) instead of one detail fetch per node.
  - Reading a settled instance's `status` returns the cached value without an API call.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e5a30f7: Add `date` and `cal` builtins, in the spirit of their UNIX namesakes and fully self-contained (pure computation — no host binary, no subprocess). `date` prints the current date/time with the familiar default format, `-u` for UTC, and `+FORMAT` strftime-style format strings (it reports the time only, never sets the clock). `cal` prints a month (`cal`), a whole year (`cal <year>`), or a specific month (`cal <month> <year>`), with today highlighted. Both return their output in an envelope through the sink, so they work identically local, over a CALYPSO daemon, and in the standalone binary.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c2087d0: Add a `fortune` builtin — the classic UNIX fortune cookie, as a shell builtin. It prints a random fortune and is fully self-contained: the content is bundled (vendored from the traditional fortune-mod datfiles, classic BSD `fortune` material), so it needs no host `fortune` binary and no datfiles on disk, and behaves identically in a local shell, over a CALYPSO daemon, and in the standalone binary. Output travels in an envelope through the sink like every other command. Regenerate the bundled set with `scripts/fortunes_generate.mjs`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 880d37a: `chell --version` reported brasa's version in place of chell's: the version module moved into brasa during the engine split but still read its own `package.json` as "chell", so it printed brasa's number. It now resolves every package by name (reading brasa's own directly) and reports the full stack — chell, brasa, chili, salsa, cumin, calypso — with versions aligned in a column. A new `chell --info` flag prints a role-grouped table (surfaces / engine / layers) of each package, its full name, and version. The version report, the `--info` table, and the boot panel all draw from a single source of truth in brasa (`stackInfo_get`), and the standalone binary inlines every stack version at build time.
- e43f42a: Delegating an unknown chell command to chili no longer stalls or floods the terminal with context-init errors when the current directory is a pure-VFS path (`/proc`, `/net`, ...). chili now registers its file-group and plugin-context commands without resolving any ChRIS context — each controller is created lazily, only when a command's action runs — so an unrelated command (or a directory that is not a ChRIS folder) pays no network cost and produces no setup-time error wall. chili also exports `commandNames_get()`, a cheap network-free listing of its top-level commands. In brasa, the "delegating to chili" notice is now emitted on the live sink before chili runs, so it appears ahead of chili's output instead of after it; and a command chili does not know (a typo, a host program) is reported as `command not found` without delegating at all.

### Patch Changes

- 512e14f: Fix `<command> --help` leaking to a daemon's terminal instead of reaching the surface. The `--help` flag path printed help through `console.log`, which on a CALYPSO daemon landed on the daemon's own terminal — and returned an empty envelope, so a remote surface saw nothing. Help now travels in an envelope through the sink like every other command output, so `--help` reaches the surface that asked for it and never prints on the daemon. This removes the last console-based path in the help flow (`help_show`).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a0d3df5: The engine no longer intercepts the console anywhere. The pipe/redirect `output_capture` monkeypatch is deleted: pipes now capture through a `PipeCaptureSink` scoped over the (re-activated) `AsyncLocalStorage` sink scope, ANSI-stripping text writes and keeping binary writes (a raw `cat` of a DICOM file) byte-for-byte. `chiliCommand_run` drives chili through its `run_capture` seam and returns an envelope, so the pacs passthroughs and the unknown-command fallback are envelope-based. The remaining print-direct builtins are converted: `store`, `upload`, `download`, `connect`, `edit` return envelopes, while the streaming commands `pull`, `pipeline`, and `pacs` emit incremental output through the sink so it streams live to a terminal or daemon and is captured in a pipe.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d69b086: Every printing builtin now returns a `CommandEnvelope` instead of writing to the console. `files`/`links`/`dirs`, `feed`, `plugin`, and `parametersofplugin` were the last holdouts; with them converted, the per-invocation console monkeypatch (`printingHandler_wrap`, which hijacked `console.log`/`console.error`/`process.stdout.write` to capture a builtin's output) is deleted, along with the `LiveEnvelopeOutputSink` marker that only served it.

  Behavioural notes: unknown subcommands of these resource commands now return a clear error envelope instead of spawning a chili subprocess, and `search` is handled natively via `list --search`. The unknown-_command_ fallback still delegates to chili, now over the same print-direct path as the other unconverted handlers.
