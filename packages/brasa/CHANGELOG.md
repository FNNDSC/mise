# @fnndsc/brasa

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e5a30f7: Add `date` and `cal` builtins, in the spirit of their UNIX namesakes and fully self-contained (pure computation — no host binary, no subprocess). `date` prints the current date/time with the familiar default format, `-u` for UTC, and `+FORMAT` strftime-style format strings (it reports the time only, never sets the clock). `cal` prints a month (`cal`), a whole year (`cal <year>`), or a specific month (`cal <month> <year>`), with today highlighted. Both return their output in an envelope through the sink, so they work identically local, over a CALYPSO daemon, and in the standalone binary.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c2087d0: Add a `fortune` builtin — the classic UNIX fortune cookie, as a shell builtin. It prints a random fortune and is fully self-contained: the content is bundled (vendored from the traditional fortune-mod datfiles, classic BSD `fortune` material), so it needs no host `fortune` binary and no datfiles on disk, and behaves identically in a local shell, over a CALYPSO daemon, and in the standalone binary. Output travels in an envelope through the sink like every other command. Regenerate the bundled set with `scripts/fortunes_generate.mjs`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 880d37a: `chell --version` reported brasa's version in place of chell's: the version module moved into brasa during the engine split but still read its own `package.json` as "chell", so it printed brasa's number. It now resolves every package by name (reading brasa's own directly) and reports the full stack — chell, brasa, chili, salsa, cumin, calypso — with versions aligned in a column. A new `chell --info` flag prints a role-grouped table (surfaces / engine / layers) of each package, its full name, and version. The version report, the `--info` table, and the boot panel all draw from a single source of truth in brasa (`stackInfo_get`), and the standalone binary inlines every stack version at build time.
- e43f42a: Delegating an unknown chell command to chili no longer stalls or floods the terminal with context-init errors when the current directory is a pure-VFS path (`/proc`, `/net`, ...). chili now registers its file-group and plugin-context commands without resolving any ChRIS context — each controller is created lazily, only when a command's action runs — so an unrelated command (or a directory that is not a ChRIS folder) pays no network cost and produces no setup-time error wall. chili also exports `commandNames_get()`, a cheap network-free listing of its top-level commands. In brasa, the "delegating to chili" notice is now emitted on the live sink before chili runs, so it appears ahead of chili's output instead of after it; and a command chili does not know (a typo, a host program) is reported as `command not found` without delegating at all.

### Patch Changes

- 512e14f: Fix `<command> --help` leaking to a daemon's terminal instead of reaching the surface. The `--help` flag path printed help through `console.log`, which on a CALYPSO daemon landed on the daemon's own terminal — and returned an empty envelope, so a remote surface saw nothing. Help now travels in an envelope through the sink like every other command output, so `--help` reaches the surface that asked for it and never prints on the daemon. This removes the last console-based path in the help flow (`help_show`).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a0d3df5: The engine no longer intercepts the console anywhere. The pipe/redirect `output_capture` monkeypatch is deleted: pipes now capture through a `PipeCaptureSink` scoped over the (re-activated) `AsyncLocalStorage` sink scope, ANSI-stripping text writes and keeping binary writes (a raw `cat` of a DICOM file) byte-for-byte. `chiliCommand_run` drives chili through its `run_capture` seam and returns an envelope, so the pacs passthroughs and the unknown-command fallback are envelope-based. The remaining print-direct builtins are converted: `store`, `upload`, `download`, `connect`, `edit` return envelopes, while the streaming commands `pull`, `pipeline`, and `pacs` emit incremental output through the sink so it streams live to a terminal or daemon and is captured in a pipe.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d69b086: Every printing builtin now returns a `CommandEnvelope` instead of writing to the console. `files`/`links`/`dirs`, `feed`, `plugin`, and `parametersofplugin` were the last holdouts; with them converted, the per-invocation console monkeypatch (`printingHandler_wrap`, which hijacked `console.log`/`console.error`/`process.stdout.write` to capture a builtin's output) is deleted, along with the `LiveEnvelopeOutputSink` marker that only served it.

  Behavioural notes: unknown subcommands of these resource commands now return a clear error envelope instead of spawning a chili subprocess, and `search` is handled natively via `list --search`. The unknown-_command_ fallback still delegates to chili, now over the same print-direct path as the other unconverted handlers.
