/**
 * @file Archiving a directory so it can leave CUBE as one file.
 *
 * CUBE serves a file's bytes but has no representation of a directory, so a
 * client that wants a copy of a tree must build one. The platform's own answer
 * is a registered pipeline — `pl-dircopy` into a zip plugin — and using it is
 * right: making an archive is a computation, and computations here are
 * plugins. What is wrong is where that orchestration has historically lived.
 * The ChRIS web UI carried it in a saga, so no other client could reuse it,
 * and a presentation layer became an orchestrator. Here it is an intent, in
 * the kernel, reached identically by every surface.
 *
 * The cost is real and worth stating: an archive run creates a feed, so the
 * compute graph records a copy as though it were an analysis step. That is a
 * CUBE gap, filed as issue #233, not a design choice — the day CUBE can hand
 * over a directory, this module is deleted.
