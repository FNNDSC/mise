 * function anything else can call. Rather than grow a dependency on a
 * package the stack is trying to shed, the rule is stated here, once, and
 * the PACS answer is the first thing to use it.
 *
 * The shape is settled by doctrine rather than by convenience: a row per
 * STUDY (or, asked with `--series`, per series), and a row for every
 * patient that owns none. The MRNs that come
 * back are the ones with imaging, so a table built from studies alone
