/**
 * @file Watches: keeping a running feed live while someone is looking.
 *
 * A watch is a refcounted subscription on one feed. While any owner (a
 * surface id, or the operator at a console) holds it, a sampler visits the
 * feed on an adaptive cadence — {@link WATCH_FLOOR_MS} while it changes,
 * doubling on quiet ticks to {@link WATCH_CAP_MS} — and, whenever the visit
 * changed the cache, publishes the feed's refreshed `feed.dag` model on the
 * ambient bus. When the feed settles (every node terminal, no work pending)
 * the sampler reports `settled` and stops: a settled feed cannot change, so
 * there is nothing left to keep live. A visit that fails reports `stale` and
 * keeps trying at the capped cadence.
 *
 * The kernel never polls on its own. The open pane is the subscription.
 *
 * @module
