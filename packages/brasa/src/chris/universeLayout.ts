/**
 * @file The universe laid out once, by the session, for every surface.
 *
 * A surface draws the universe from where each node stands; finding where
 * costs a settle that grows with the space (a minute for 26,000 spheres on
 * a laptop, longer on a phone). The session pays it once per identity: when
 * the index is whole it lays out each layout the surfaces offer, in a worker
 * thread, from the same graph and the same engine input a browser would
 * build, and keeps the places beside the index checkpoint. A surface that
 * asks meanwhile reads how far it has come.
 *
 * A layout already kept is not laid out again; DATA, whose hubs are the
 * data facts, waits for the facts sweep to settle and is laid out afresh.
 *
 * @module
