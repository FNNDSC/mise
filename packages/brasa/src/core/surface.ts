/**
 * @file Surface capabilities: the input/interaction seam a host provides.
 *
 * The output sink (`./sink.js`) lets a host decide where a command's output
 * goes. This module is its input-side counterpart: it lets a host declare
 * what *interaction* it can offer — prompting for a line, reading a secret
 * without echo, opening a local editor — and lets a builtin ask for a
 * capability and fail with a clear message when the attached surface cannot
 * provide it, rather than hanging on a standard input that is not there.
 *
 * The CLI host backs this with readline and the local `$EDITOR`; a future
 * daemon backs it with request messages to a remote surface, and a surface
 * that cannot (say) open a local editor simply declares `localEdit: false`.
 *
 * Capabilities the surface can act on directly (prompting) are methods here;
 * capabilities a builtin still performs itself (local editing, whose editor
 * mechanics remain in the `edit` builtin until a remote surface needs its
 * own implementation) are declared as flags a builtin gates on via
 * {@link capability_require}. This module is deliberately free of Node
 * built-ins so it stays trivially testable and host-agnostic; the readline
 * implementation lives in `./cliSurface.js`.
 *
 * @see docs/calypso.adoc — "Interactivity is a declared surface capability".
 * @module

// The delivery request and result cross the wire, so they are declared once in

// gets the bytes is its own business: the local CLI reads through the
// in-process engine, a remote CLI and a browser both fetch the daemon's
// token-gated byte route. Pushing bytes through the session bus instead would
// base64 a DICOM series across a channel meant for session state.
