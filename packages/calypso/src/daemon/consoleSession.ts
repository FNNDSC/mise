/**
 * @file The daemon console: the terminal a daemon booted in becomes its
 * first surface.
 *
 * A Linux boot ends at a login. A daemon boot ended at a resting face — a
 * brain animation and a status line, with the boot log a keypress away —
 * that was a screensaver where a session belonged. The identity is already
 * resolved by the time the engine is ready, so the login is the attach: an
 * ordinary `chell --remote` surface is put on the daemon's own terminal.
 *
 * It is a child process on the wire, not an in-process shortcut. The daemon
 * process holds one output sink and one interaction surface for every
 * attached session; a REPL started inside it would take those over and
 * every other surface would go quiet. A child pays one loopback hop, which
 * is what every surface pays, and shares nothing else.
 *
 * `exit` in the console detaches; the daemon stays up, its terminal idle.
 * Enter attaches again. Ctrl-C at that idle terminal stops the daemon, as
 * it always did. While the console holds the terminal, whatever the daemon
 * itself writes — a roster row, a late warm-up settling — is held and
 * handed back on detach, so it lands after the surface's last line and
 * never across its prompt.
 *
 * The console lives here, in the daemon's own package, because both the
 * chell `--daemon` host and the standalone `calypso` binary end their boot
 * this way. What differs between them is only how the surface is launched —
 * chell spawns itself, the calypso binary spawns `chell` from the path — so
 * that is the one injected part.
 *
