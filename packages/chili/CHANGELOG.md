## 3.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 66bc932: Add ChELL group membership commands and include current CUBE usernames in the
  live `/etc/group` projection.
- 8ec8a4b: Add explicit, command-scoped CUBE elevation with `sudo <command>`. The active surface collects an administrator identity and hidden password; a temporary CUBE client runs only the nested command, then the normal session is restored. Group membership and plugin registration now suggest a copyable `sudo` rerun after an authorization failure, and plugin registration no longer owns a separate interactive admin prompt.
- d0ac04f: Preserve failure causes and tighten cache contracts. Errors that were replaced by generic messages now carry their real cause: controller and handler creation failures name the underlying error instead of "no ChRIS context", `cat` shows the actual fetch failure, docker command failures surface stderr detail, context-set errors actually print, settings load/save failures are announced instead of silently using defaults or losing changes, unreadable berth and discovery files are named instead of reading as "no daemon", token-file read errors are distinguished from the logged-out state, and resource deletes report why they failed. Every remaining deliberate error absorption now carries a dated adjudication comment. Cache contracts: the PACS provider's decoded-query cache caches settled results only and is size-bounded; the object-context factory gains an eviction hook (`objContext_evict`) for deleted plugin or feed ids; `mv` and `cp` invalidate the whole affected listing subtree; and a new PACS query invalidates the cached `/net/pacs/queries` listing so it appears in the next `ls` immediately.
- 50e9bb1: Make CUBE group membership commands name-first and batch-capable. `group members`, `group inspect`, `group adduser`, and `group removeuser` now accept an exact group name or a numeric ID; add and remove accept multiple usernames, report every result, and make already-satisfied membership changes successful no-ops.
- d0ac04f: BEHAVIOR CHANGE: failures no longer read as empty results. Commands that previously printed nothing and exited 0 when a fetch failed now report the error and exit non-zero, following the codebase's `Result<T>` pattern throughout. Affected surfaces: listing a PACS study or series that does not exist errors instead of showing an empty directory; `store list`/`store search` and `compute list` error when the store or CUBE is unreachable instead of showing no entries; plugin registration no longer defaults to the `host` compute resource when the compute fetch failed; `rm` on a feed fails when running jobs could not be cancelled instead of claiming success; a recursive scan that cannot list a subtree reports the exclusion instead of silently omitting it; batch job-status gaps and disconnected status fetches push visible warnings; the native VFS distinguishes "folder absent" from "could not verify" so probe failures no longer masquerade as missing directories; `cp` fails when path resolution fails rather than proceeding with a guessed path; join-edge resolution retries after a transient failure instead of permanently recording no joins; and the remote client reports invalid daemon messages instead of silently dropping them. Exit codes are now truthful end to end: `ls` reports an error status when any listing fails instead of aggregating failures into success, and `chell -c` derives its exit code from the command's envelopes, so a failed one-shot command exits non-zero even when the builtin did not set an exit code itself.
- 0e92d4d: Persist and reconcile daemon `/proc` checkpoints, fix wildcard listing of
  virtual executables, keep remote admin prompts on their originating surface,
  add a Unix-style `id` builtin for the current CUBE UID/GID projection and group
  memberships, and make versioned-plugin help, parameters, and README output
  compose correctly through terminals, pipes, and redirects.

## 3.6.1

### Patch Changes

## 3.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e43f42a: Delegating an unknown chell command to chili no longer stalls or floods the terminal with context-init errors when the current directory is a pure-VFS path (`/proc`, `/net`, ...). chili now registers its file-group and plugin-context commands without resolving any ChRIS context — each controller is created lazily, only when a command's action runs — so an unrelated command (or a directory that is not a ChRIS folder) pays no network cost and produces no setup-time error wall. chili also exports `commandNames_get()`, a cheap network-free listing of its top-level commands. In brasa, the "delegating to chili" notice is now emitted on the live sink before chili runs, so it appears ahead of chili's output instead of after it; and a command chili does not know (a typo, a host program) is reported as `command not found` without delegating at all.

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a0d3df5: chili's command layer no longer prints straight to the console. A new output seam (`screen/output.ts`) routes all command output through a swappable `ChiliWriter` — `chiliLog`/`chiliErrLog`/`chiliWrite` — whose default delegates to the process console, so the standalone CLI is unchanged. A host captures a run's output with `chili_capture(fn)`, and `run_capture(argv)` runs a single command with its output collected as strings, so an in-process host (the brasa engine) can drive chili headless without a console monkeypatch.

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d69b086: Add sans-I/O rendering variants alongside the existing printing ones, so hosted surfaces can carry command output in an envelope rather than relying on the caller to capture `console.log`: `pluginParameters_manRender` (view), `PluginContextGroupHandler.parameters_listManRender` / `parameters_fieldsRender`, and `BaseGroupHandler.resourceFields_render`. The original printing forms are unchanged and still used by chili's own CLI.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- asciidoctor 3 → 4 (dependency-free, drops the deprecated glob/inflight chain); the man renderer's `browser_open` is now async. Removed the unused `node-fetch` dependency (Node ≥ 22 global fetch).
