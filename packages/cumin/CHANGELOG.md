## 3.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f0833a: Release the coordinated ChELL stack with deterministic `/proc` topology progress, complete visible-feed indexing, safe warm-up query gating, remote one-shot command completion, and refreshed daemon documentation.

## 3.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e630f79: Draw registered CUBE pipelines with `pipeline diagram <id|name>` or the `/bin` shorthand `<pipeline> --diagram`. Bare output uses the same shallow tree machinery as feed diagrams, `--withargs` appends stored non-null plugin defaults, and `--signalflow` emits the same SignalFlow YAML dialect as feeds. `feed diagram <specifier>` is now a shallow alias of `feed tree`; feed graph commands accept IDs, `feed_N`, exact or unambiguous title searches, and infer the feed from the current `feed_N` directory when omitted.

## 3.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a1f6694: Feed-DAG data layer. Projects a feed's cached plugin-instance topology into a flat,
  surface-agnostic `FeedGraph` and resolves topological-join (`ts`) edges.

  - **cumin:** `ProcInstance` gains `pluginType` (authoritative `ts` detection) and
    `joinParentIDs` (cached join overlay); `ProcCache.joinParents_update`/`joinParents_get`
    and `feedInstanceIDs_get` (anchor-tree traversal).
  - **salsa:** `feedGraph_build` + `signature_compute` (a per-node topology signature — a
    hash of plugin name plus the sorted child signatures, status excluded — so surfaces can
    group isomorphic siblings without re-deriving the grouping); `feedJoins_ensure` /
    `nodeJoins_resolve` fetch a join node's `plugininstances` parameter and record its extra
    parents (sources minus the anchor).

## 3.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d358c5: /proc now caches settled job status. A finished plugin instance
  (`finishedSuccessfully`, `finishedWithError`, `cancelled`) never changes, so its
  status is kept permanently once observed. Consequences:

  - Listing a fully-finished feed under `/proc/jobs` is instant — no status calls.
  - Live status for active feeds is refreshed with a single feed-scoped list call
    (the list response already carries `status`) instead of one detail fetch per node.
  - Reading a settled instance's `status` returns the cached value without an API call.

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- aa81b0a: Add the error stream to the envelope contract and convert the first fs builtins. `CommandEnvelope` gains `renderedErr` (printable stderr text, ANSI permitted), keeping the error stream separate from pipeable data; `envelope_error` accepts it as a third argument; the structured `errors` field is machine-facing and no longer presented by delivery. chell's `OutputSink` gains `err_write` (stdout sink routes to stderr; capture sink passes through uncaptured, matching today's pipe semantics). Builtins converted: `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch` (models `fs.cwd`, `fs.mkdir`, `fs.touch`), rendered and error-stream bytes identical to the previous behavior.
- 2099ff6: Make the error stack async-context aware and drain it per command. cumin's `errorStack` gains `scope_run` (run work against an isolated stack), `checkpoint_mark`, and `checkpoint_drain`: fire-and-forget background work (topology warm-up, background cache refresh) now runs inside its own scope so its error traffic cannot land in a concurrent foreground command's drain window. chell's dispatch checkpoints the stack before each command and drains anything pushed above the checkpoint into the envelope's `errors` field, escalating status to `error` when a genuine error was left on the stack — a reliable per-command failure signal that also retires the exit-code-delta status heuristic's blind spot (a later failing batch segment no longer reads `ok`). CLI behavior is byte-identical.
- c47ff22: Add the command result envelope (`CommandEnvelope`, `EnvelopeModel`, `ResolutionTrace`, `envelope_ok`, `envelope_error`, `envelope_isOk`): the typed container in which a command's outcome travels from execution to its host, carrying rendered terminal text alongside an optional kind-tagged model, drained error detail, and an optional intent-resolution trace. See docs/calypso.adoc for the governing design.

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- The typed payload extractors (`listData_get`, `itemData_get`, `items_get`) and common chrisapi types (`PluginInstance`, `Feed`, `FileBrowserFolder`, ...) are re-exported from the package index. The `chrisConnection` singleton is now initialized in place instead of reassigned, fixing stale named-import bindings in ESM consumers.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Route all chrisapi access through a single adapter seam (`src/chrisapi/adapter.ts`). The public API is unchanged; responses whose `data` payload is missing now surface as errors instead of propagating `undefined`. Enforced repo-wide by a new `lint:seam` CI check.
