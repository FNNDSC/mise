/**
 * @file The PACS query index: what has already been asked, and answered.
 *
 * CUBE keeps every PACS query it has run, criteria and result both, so a
 * question asked before need not be asked again. It cannot be *searched*
 * for, though: the queries collection accepts no parameter over the stored
 * criteria, and every row of every page drags its compressed result along —
 * kilobytes each, thousands of rows. Looking a question up by sweeping that
 * collection would cost megabytes, and would cost them most often on a
 * MISS, which is the common case for a genuinely new query. A client that
 * searched naively would make every new query slower than not searching.
 *
 * So the collection is walked once, in the background, and what is learned
 * is kept here: criteria and server in, the stored query's id out. A lookup
 * is then a map read.
 *
 * The index is ADVISORY. A hit is a claim to be confirmed — the caller
 * decodes the stored result before serving it, and any failure (the query
 * deleted, the result unreadable) falls through to a fresh query. A stale
 * entry can therefore cost a wasted lookup and never a wrong answer, which
 * is what makes it safe to keep across restarts and to fill lazily.
 *
 * It is also the log itself. Each entry carries the criteria and owner the
 * VFS renders into `/net/pacs/queries/<name>`, so that listing can be
 * served from here — complete, rather than the first page of it.
 *
 * @module
