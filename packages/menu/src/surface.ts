/**
 * @file The engine's contract with the place it runs: where its output goes
 * (`OutputSink`) and what it may ask of whoever drives it (`Surface`).
 *
 * The engine writes output to a sink and asks a surface for what only a
 * surface can give — a hidden prompt, a local editor, a host shell, a file
 * delivered to the operator's machine. A terminal, a session daemon and a
 * test each provide their own; these interfaces are what all of them meet.
 * Types only, like the rest of menu; the implementations live with the
 * engine and the hosts.
 *
 * Served as the subpath `@fnndsc/menu/surface` rather than from the package
 * root, so a browser bundle that imports menu never meets Node's `Buffer`.

/**
 * What interaction an attached surface can provide.
 *
 * @property hiddenInput - The surface can read a line without echoing it
 *   (password entry).
 * @property localEdit - The surface can open content in a local editor and
 *   return the edited result.
 * @property tty - The surface is an interactive terminal (as opposed to a
 *   pipe, a script, or a headless host).
 * @property color - The surface renders ANSI colour. A colour terminal and a
 *   browser console both do; a bare pipe or a file does not. A command that
 *   can render richly with colour and plainly without it — an image thumbnail
 *   as ANSI half-blocks or an ASCII ramp — reads this to choose, and the
 *   plain rendering is always the floor.
 * @property pipeSegments - The surface can run a pipeline's non-first
 *   segments (`... | grep foo`) through its own tools. Nothing ever spawns on
 *   a daemon host: the local CLI runs segments in-process, a remote CLI runs
 *   them on the client machine, and a browser surface lacks the capability
 *   and fails such pipelines with a clear message.
 * @property shellCommands - The surface can run a `!`-prefixed host-shell
 *   command on its own machine. A daemon delegates this capability to the
 *   command's originating surface and never launches the process itself.
 * @property fileDelivery - The surface can put a file where its operator can
 *   reach it. What that means is the surface's business — a path on the local
 *   CLI's disk, a path on a remote CLI's client machine, a saved file in a
 *   browser — but never the daemon host's disk.
 * @property engineFilesystem - The surface's operator sits at the same
 *   filesystem the engine runs on, so a path the engine resolves is a path
 *   they can open. True only for an in-process local shell. When false, a
 *   builtin that would write to disk must deliver through the surface instead,
 *   because the engine's disk is somebody else's machine.
 * @property localFilesystem - The surface can put many files into a directory
 *   structure of its own. True for any shell, remote included; false for a
 *   browser, which has no directory to fill and can only accept files one at a
 *   time. It answers a different question from `engineFilesystem`: not *whose*
 *   disk, but whether there is one at all.
