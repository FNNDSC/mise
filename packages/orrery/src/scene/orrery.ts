/**
 * @file The orrery itself: one three.js space, composed of the layers.
 *
 * A surface hands in a graph — nodes with identity, parents and joins, a
 * scalar metric, a multiplicity, and a LOOK it has read from its own domain
 * (a state, a named paint, an ember, whether the finish wave passes) — and
 * the orrery lays it out (`layout/`), draws it (`draw/`), and lets it be
 * steered and picked (`controls/`). It knows nothing of what the nodes
 * stand for: a surface says what a node looks like, and gets its own nodes
 * back from every pick.
 *
 * Layout is a strategy seam:
 * - `ranked`: deterministic tiers by graph depth; the same graph always
 *   draws the same picture, the third dimension is presentation.
 * - `molecule`: a d3-force-3d settle, radii scaled by the metric; a surface
 *   that groups its nodes (a hand-off key) settles in a worker it provides.
 *
 * Colours come from the palette the surface hands in, read on every
 * rebuild, so a theme change repaints the space like everything else.
 *
 * The scene composes its parts, each in its own file beside this one: the
 * settle (`settle.ts`), the pulse wave (`wave.ts`), the replay track
 * (`replayTrack.ts`), the grab (`grab.ts`) and the hover tip (`hover.ts`).
 * This file holds the fields, the rebuild and the draw, and the public face
 * a surface mounts.
 *
