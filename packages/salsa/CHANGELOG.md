## 3.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Project registered pipelines as typed invocation manifests, validate and merge
  sparse parameter/resource overlays, and create Workflows from complete node sets.
- Preserve plugin parameter values as typed data through Cumin execution.
- Updated dependencies
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.8.4

## 3.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Export a typed feed-creation result so PACS, plugin, and future pipeline
  workflows can share the same feed/root identity contract.
- Updated dependencies
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.8.3

## 3.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f0833a: Release the coordinated ChELL stack with deterministic `/proc` topology progress, complete visible-feed indexing, safe warm-up query gating, remote one-shot command completion, and refreshed daemon documentation.
- Updated dependencies [6f0833a]
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.8.1

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e630f79: Draw registered CUBE pipelines with `pipeline diagram <id|name>` or the `/bin` shorthand `<pipeline> --diagram`. Bare output uses the same shallow tree machinery as feed diagrams, `--withargs` appends stored non-null plugin defaults, and `--signalflow` emits the same SignalFlow YAML dialect as feeds. `feed diagram <specifier>` is now a shallow alias of `feed tree`; feed graph commands accept IDs, `feed_N`, exact or unambiguous title searches, and infer the feed from the current `feed_N` directory when omitted.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e630f79]
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.8.0

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a1f6694: Feed-DAG data layer. Projects a feed's cached plugin-instance topology into a flat,
  surface-agnostic `FeedGraph` and resolves topological-join (`ts`) edges.

  - **cumin:** `ProcInstance` gains `pluginType` (authoritative `ts` detection) and
    `joinParentIDs` (cached join overlay); `ProcCache.joinParents_update`/`joinParents_get`
    and `feedInstanceIDs_get` (anchor-tree traversal).
  - **salsa:** `feedGraph_build` + `signature_compute` (a per-node topology signature — a
    hash of plugin name plus the sorted child signatures, status excluded — so surfaces can
    group isomorphic siblings without re-deriving the grouping); `feedJoins_ensure` /
    `nodeJoins_resolve` fetch a join node's `plugininstances` parameter and record its extra
    parents (sources minus the anchor).

- 01ab743: `feed tree` now builds the DAG **cache-first** from the warm ProcCache instead of
  re-crawling the feed on every call. It reuses already-loaded topology, fetches feed
  metadata only when missing or a placeholder, refreshes volatile status cheaply (one
  feed-scoped list call, active nodes only) when reusing a warm cache, and resolves join
  edges lazily. New salsa exports: `feedGraphData_ensure`, `feedMeta_ensure`,
  `feedInstances_ensureLoaded`, `feedStatus_refresh`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a1f6694]
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.7.0

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d358c5: /proc now caches settled job status. A finished plugin instance
  (`finishedSuccessfully`, `finishedWithError`, `cancelled`) never changes, so its
  status is kept permanently once observed. Consequences:

  - Listing a fully-finished feed under `/proc/jobs` is instant — no status calls.
  - Live status for active feeds is refreshed with a single feed-scoped list call
    (the list response already carries `status`) instead of one detail fetch per node.
  - Reading a settled instance's `status` returns the cached value without an API call.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0d358c5]
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.6.0

## 3.2.6

### Patch Changes

- The PACS VFS content reader parses query folder ids with the same helper as the listing provider; `cat metadata.json` inside `/net/pacs/queries/...` directories works again (it failed with "Invalid query ID in path" on the modern `<desc>_qid:<id>` folder naming).

## 3.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Test coverage lock-in: global coverage ratchets raised and a 60% per-file floor enforced in CI. No runtime changes.
- Updated dependencies
  - @fnndsc/cumin@3.3.0
